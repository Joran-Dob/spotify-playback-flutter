Spotify Playback Plugin.

**No iOS Implementation yet, WIP..**

## Features
* Play (track / album / playlist)
* Resume / pause
* Queue
* Playback position
* Seek
* Seek to relative position
* Play Next
* Play Previous
* Repeat 
* Shuffle 

## Installation
**`IMPORTANT:` Make sure you have the Spotify app installed and that you are logged in or your test device!**

First, add `spotify_playback` as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

Then initialize the spotify playback sdk like this 

```dart
@override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    initConnector();
  }

  /// Initialize the spotify playback sdk, by calling spotifyConnect
  Future<void> initConnector() async {
    try {
      await SpotifyPlayback.spotifyConnect(clientId: "", redirectUrl: "").then(
          (connected) {
        if (!mounted) return;
        // If the method call is successful, update the state to reflect this change
        setState(() {
          _connectedToSpotify = connected;
        });
      }, onError: (error) {
        // If the method call trows an error, print the error to see what went wrong
        print(error);
      });
    } on PlatformException {
      print('Failed to connect.');
    }
  }
``` 

After this you can use all the available methods
